  <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Transportation systems play a pivotal role in shaping consumer behavior, enhancing market
accessibility, and fostering regional industrial growth. This study, titled " Driving Accessibility: The Influence of Transport Infrastructure on Consumer Preferences and Regional Markets," explores the impact of transportation infrastructure on economic activity and purchasing patterns. Drawing data from 180 respondents, the research employs statistical tools such as chi-square tests, logistic regression, and time-series forecasting using R to analyze the interplay between transportation modes, accessibility, and consumer behavior. Findings reveal that efficient public transport significantly improves market access, increasing consumer mobility and economic participation. In contrast, inadequate infrastructure restricts access, limiting consumer choice and hindering business expansion. The study also highlights that well-connected transportation networks contribute to higher purchasing frequency and increased consumer spending, with commercially active regions benefiting from robust mobility systems. Multiple regression analysis further confirms that consistent investment in transportation infrastructure is a key driver of regional industrial growth, with forecasts indicating a potential 5–7% annual growth rate when infrastructure development is sustained. These insights hold valuable implications for policymakers, urban planners, and business leaders. The research advocates for strategic enhancements in public transit, road connectivity, and sustainable transport initiatives to stimulate economic development. By strengthening transportation accessibility, regions can boost trade, attract investment, and empower consumers—ultimately paving the way for long-term socioeconomic progress</p>
